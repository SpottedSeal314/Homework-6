**Scenario**: You are an enterprising coder for a data storage company. They store their own data in their own lists, but often have problems knowing how much data they have stored. It is up to you to fix their program to count how many passwords, users, or other data they have stored!


**Task**: Your goal is to change the _count_instances_ method to count the number of instances _target_ appears within _data_. Your goal is to finish this as safely and efficiently as possible.


_Post Note_: This is an assignment made for INF 113 and our group is not totally experienced with cyber security, just coding in Python. This is our best approximation of what we believe a good challenge to be.
